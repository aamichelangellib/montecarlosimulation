# montecarlosimulation
  This project uses Monte Carlo simulation with VBA and Excel to estimate time, cost, and risk in project management. It generates probabilistic outcomes to assess potential risks and guide decisions. Though the model provides approximations, it helps adjust schedules and budgets, enhancing project reliability and minimizing unforeseen issues.
